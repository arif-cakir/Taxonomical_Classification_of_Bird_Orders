# Taxonomical Classification of Bird Orders

In this project, firstly it is aimed to taxonomically classify bird species in respect of their physiological and ethological characteristics and secondly, creating new labels as close as possible to taxonomic labels with the help of clustering algorithms.

  In biological taxonomy, organisms are classified by their basis of shared physical likeness with the help of eight hierarchical categories which are: domain, kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species. This hierarchy goes from general to specific and all classes are an inclusive group of higher ranks. Moreover, it is planned to verify that physiological and ethological characteristics like egg size, incubation duration, development model, etc. can be used as an indicator of taxonomic classification in this project. Aves class contains 27 orders, 98 families, and 338 genera; due to the higher number of families and genera, orders are going to be used in this project.
